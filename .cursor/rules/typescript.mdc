globs: **/*{.ts,.tsx}

- Use TypeScript for all code; prefer `type` over `interface`.
- Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples.
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes.
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., `isLoading`, `hasError`).
- Leverage Prisma's generated types for database operations.
- Use proper generic types for reusable components and functions.
- Implement strict type checking with proper null/undefined handling.
- Use discriminated unions for complex state management.
- Implement proper typing for server actions and API responses.
- Use const assertions for immutable data structures.
- Implement proper typing for React component props and state.
- Use utility types (Pick, Omit, Partial) for type transformations.
- Implement proper error typing with custom error types.
- Use type guards for runtime type checking.
- Leverage TypeScript's template literal types for string validation.
