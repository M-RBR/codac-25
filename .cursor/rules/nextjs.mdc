- Favor React Server Components (RSC) where possible.
- Minimize `'use client'` directives - only use for interactivity.
- Optimize for performance and Web Vitals.
- Use server actions for mutations instead of API route handlers.
- Use `next/image` for optimized image loading and processing.
- Implement proper loading states and error boundaries.
- Use Next.js built-in caching strategies appropriately.
- Leverage the App Router's streaming capabilities.
- Implement proper SEO with metadata API.
- Use Next.js built-in optimizations (fonts, images, scripts).
- Follow the established routing patterns in `/app` directory.
- Use proper data fetching patterns with server components.
- Implement progressive enhancement where appropriate.
- Use dynamic imports for code splitting when beneficial.
- Optimize bundle size with proper tree shaking.
